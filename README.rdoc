= MonkeyEmoji
Encode and decode unicode emoji characters for saving in db that does not store 4 byte unicode characters.

It injects `encode_emoji` and `decode_emoji` methods to String and NilClass. ActiveRecord::Base is also injected with `encode_emoji` class method so that attributes encodes emoji automatically before save.

This project uses MIT-LICENSE.
